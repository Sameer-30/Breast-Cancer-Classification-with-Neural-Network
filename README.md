# Breast Cancer Classification with Neural Network

Excited to share that Iâ€™ve built my first neural network model for breast cancer classification! ðŸŽ¯ Using the well-known Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, I trained a model that achieved a **93.8% accuracy** on the test set. The model utilizes **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, with two dense layers and a **sigmoid activation** to classify between malignant and benign tumors.

## Dataset Overview:
- **Instances**: 569
- **Features**: 30 (including mean radius, texture, area, etc.)
- The dataset was preprocessed, split into training and testing sets, and standardized for better performance.

## Model Performance:
- **Training Accuracy**: 97.8% validation accuracy after just 10 epochs.
- **Test Accuracy**: 93.8% on the test set.

This project has provided me valuable insights into deep learning and its potential in medical diagnosis. This is just the beginning of exploring how AI can transform healthcare! ðŸ’¡
